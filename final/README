----------------------------

This is a program which is written to run server and mulitple clients. 

First the server program is run and then the client is run.
The server is run by the command line : ./server SERVER_IP SERVER_PORT MAX_CLIENTS
The client is run by the command line : ./client USER_NAME SERVER_IP SERVER_PORT

Server:

1. This has been implemented using the SBCP protocol. 
2. The server initially waits for the connections. 
3. The connection is established via a JOIN message received by the server which has the username,
server ip and server port. 
4. Multiple clients can connect to the server using the select() incorporated in the program. 
5. The message received by the server from one client is forwarded to other clients by FWD msg.
6. The code is written to run both ipv4 and ipv6.
7. The server rejects the connection from new client which trys to use a duplicating username.
8. The server frees all resources (socket and username) of the leaving client.
9. The server discards any message that does not follow SBCP protocol.  


Client.

1. The client connects to the server and joins the chat room by the JOIN message. 
2. The client sends message to the server by the SEND msg.
3. Multiple clients can join the chat room by the Select() function used.
4. The client discards any message that is not understood. 
5. The client can leave chatting room unceremoniously by typing '^'.
6. The client can receive messages from other clients in the room and simultaneously type in his/her message.
